Hi! I am Ankush (pronounced as Un-koo-sh), and as of 2024, entering my 2nd year of PhD. I am part of [The Gopinathan Group](http://gopinathanlab.ucmerced.edu/) in the [Department of Physics](https://physics.ucmerced.edu/) at the [University of California, Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/). My interests lie at the crossroads of Physics and Biology. Prior to this, I was part of the [Biophysics Group](https://biophysics.icts.res.in/) at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://www.icts.res.in/) where I worked on building a minimal model of actomyosin cytoskeleton by looking at it as an active nematic system.  

I enjoy running, playing Ultimate Frisbee, [reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64670551-ankush-gk) and watching movies/TV shows.

I also have a tumblr page (not very active), [Montage of Strokes](https://montageofstrokes.tumblr.com/), where I post non-scientific sketches and doodles.
