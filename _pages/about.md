Hi! I am Ankush (pronounced as Un-koo-sh), currently a Visiting Research Student working with the [Biophysics Group](https://biophysics.icts.res.in/) at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS)](https://www.icts.res.in/). I recently graduated with an integrated Physics and Mechanical Engineering degree from [BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/).

I intend to pursue a Ph.D. where I can do good science at the intersection of Physics and Biology.  

I enjoy playing [Ultimate Frisbee](https://vimeo.com/abracadabras/ultimate), [reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64670551-ankush-gk), [sketching](https://www.instagram.com/ankushhgk/), and watching TV shows.
